🚀 Overview  
WordyMe™ is a full-stack application built as a monorepo using Turborepo. It consists of a modern React web application and an Express.js backend API, along with shared packages for editor functionality, UI components, and type definitions. 

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

This project uses [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com) for managing a monorepo with the following structure:

#### Applications

- **`apps/web`** - Frontend React application built with Vite

#### Packages

- **`@repo/editor`** - Rich text editor built with Lexical, supporting diagrams (Mermaid), math (KaTeX), and more
- **`@repo/ui`** - Shared UI component library (shadcn/ui based)

## Running with Docker

WordyMe™ can be run using Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment. See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for complete Docker documentation, including:

- Quick start guide
- Common commands
- Data persistence and backups
- Troubleshooting
- Production considerations

**Quick Start:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The application will be available at:

- Web: http://localhost:5173
- API: http://localhost:3000

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **pnpm** 9.0.0 (specified in `packageManager` field)

### Available Scripts

From the root directory:

- `pnpm dev` - Start all apps in development mode
- `pnpm build` - Build all apps and packages
- `pnpm lint` - Lint all packages
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm check-types` - Type-check all packages
- `pnpm start` - Start all apps in production mode

### Running Specific Packages

You can run commands for specific packages using Turborepo filters:

```bash
# Run only the web app
pnpm dev --filter=web

# Run only the backend
pnpm dev --filter=@repo/backend

# Build only the web app
pnpm build --filter=web
```

## Build System

This project uses **Turborepo** for:

- **Parallel execution** - Run tasks across packages in parallel
- **Caching** - Intelligent caching of build outputs
- **Task dependencies** - Automatic dependency resolution
- **Remote caching** - Share build caches across team and CI/CD

### Remote Caching

Turborepo supports remote caching with Vercel (free for all plans). To enable:

```bash
# Authenticate with Vercel
pnpm exec turbo login

# Link your repository
pnpm exec turbo link
```

## Code Quality

### TypeScript

All packages use TypeScript with strict type checking. Type definitions are shared through `@repo/types`.

### Linting

ESLint is configured across all packages with shared configurations in `@repo/eslint-config`.

### Formatting

Prettier is used for consistent code formatting. A pre-commit hook (via Lefthook) ensures code is formatted before commits.

## Database

The backend uses **libSQL** (SQLite-compatible) for data storage. The database file is stored in `apps/backend/storage/local.db` by default.

### Migrations

Database migrations are managed with Drizzle Kit. Run migrations with:

```bash
cd apps/backend
pnpm drizzle-kit generate
pnpm drizzle-kit migrate
```

## API Documentation

The backend API includes OpenAPI documentation. When running the backend, visit `/api-docs` for interactive API documentation.

## Contributing

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
2. Run type checking: `pnpm check-types`
3. Run linting: `pnpm lint`
4. Format code: `pnpm format`
5. Run tests: `pnpm test` (where applicable)
